# Multi- Image Classification using CNN

**Project Overview**

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images into multiple categories using **TensorFlow (Keras)**. The CNN is trained offline on a labeled image dataset (e.g., of animals, fashion, or traffic signs). CNNs are ideal for image recognition tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies through convolutional layers.

This repository includes complete Google Colab notebooks for **data preprocessing**, **model building**, **training**, and **evaluation**, forming an end-to-end image classification pipeline.

### Key Highlights:

* **Purpose**: Automatically classify images into one of several predefined categories (multi-class classification).
* **Technology**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy.
* **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
* **Scope**: Batch-mode classification (offline). Not deployed for real-time predictions.
* **Use Case**: Educational demo or prototype model for further development.

The project includes two notebooks:

* `image_classification_training.ipynb` ‚Äì for data processing, training, and model saving.
* `image_classification_testing.ipynb` ‚Äì for model evaluation, testing, and visualization of predictions.

# Dataset Description

### üìÅ Common Dataset Structure:

```
/dataset
  /class1
    img1.jpg
    img2.jpg
  /class2
    ...
```

Each image is typically:

* **Grayscale or RGB**
* **Size**: 32√ó32 or 64√ó64 (resized for uniformity)
* **Labels**: Integers or one-hot encoded vectors representing the class

# Model Architecture

The CNN is implemented using **Keras' , and consists of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

### Typical Architecture:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH, CHANNELS)),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),

    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(NUM_CLASSES, activation='softmax')  # softmax for multi-class
])
```

* **Conv2D**: Detects spatial patterns like edges, curves.
* **MaxPooling2D**: Downsamples features to reduce computation and overfitting.
* **Dense Layers**: Learn high-level representations.
* **Softmax Output**: Produces class probabilities.

# Training Process

All model training is conducted in `image_classification_training.ipynb`. Steps include:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* Resize images and normalize pixel values (e.g. divide by 255).
* Encode class labels (e.g. one-hot encoding).
* Apply image augmentation (e.g. rotation, flip) to increase dataset diversity.

### 2. **Train/Test Split**

* Typically 70/30 or 80/20 ratio.
* Optionally use a validation set to monitor overfitting.

### 3. **Compile Model**

```python
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',  # for multi-class
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

* **Adam**: Popular adaptive optimizer.
* **Categorical Crossentropy**: Suitable for multi-class tasks.
* **Accuracy**: Main evaluation metric.

### 4. **Training**

```python
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

* Monitors training/validation loss and accuracy.
* Includes plots for visual tracking of overfitting/underfitting.

# Evaluation and Testing

Model testing occurs in `image_classification_testing.ipynb`.

### ‚úÖ Metrics:

* Test set accuracy (e.g. 85‚Äì90% depending on dataset complexity).
* Confusion matrix to visualize class-wise performance.
* Classification report (precision, recall).

###  Visual Output:

* Show sample test images alongside predicted and actual labels.
* Plot model performance over epochs.

# Key Results & Insights

### Performance:

* CNNs achieved robust classification accuracy (e.g., 88‚Äì92% on Fashion-MNIST).
* Accuracy improved with data augmentation and deeper architectures.

### Class-wise Accuracy:

* Some classes may be harder to distinguish (e.g. cat vs. dog).
* Confusion matrices reveal which labels the model confuses most.

### Overfitting Mitigation:

* Regularization techniques such as dropout or image augmentation help reduce overfitting.
* Validation accuracy is monitored to prevent excessive training.

# Limitations

* **Small Dataset**: Limited generalization if dataset is small or biased.
* **Compute Cost**: CNNs require more GPU resources for large datasets.
* **Real-world Application**: This is an offline model and not ready for real-time deployment.
